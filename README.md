## Disclaimer

This is an *experimental technology* (proof-of-concept).
therefore it is still very raw and unfinished

### (Recipe for the core team)

1. create a PYTHON package using `make_package.bat` (uses `setup.py`+the whole folder)
1. after extensive testing under virtual env, publish the release with: `twine upload dist/*`

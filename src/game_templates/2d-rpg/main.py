"""
2D-RPG Template
---------------
Showcasing very basic features for a rpg:
 - loot, and an inventory system
 - evolving stats, used during combat
 - the ability to kill mobs (monsters, enemies)
 - when you try to kill monsters that are too strong you die
Technical stuff:
 - multi-state game with a menu screen
